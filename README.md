Instructions for running the code:
  1. The code is meant to be run on a Windows OS (preferably, a python venv) with Tensorflow installed.
  2. Using a venv/virtualenv with jupyter notebook will require some additional setup which can be found here -> https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/
  3. Save the dataset in "./dataset/coil-100", if the current working directory is the one in which the ipynb is saved.
  4. Execute the ipynb with kernel changed to the one with tensorflow.
