## Requirements

* **Tensorflow 2.x** (Anything above Tensorflow 2.0)

## Instructions (Running the Python files directly)

Instructions for running the code directly:
1. Get the *COIL-100* dataset and place it on `./dataset/coil-100`, **OR** run this helper script, which will automatically do this for you:
```
python fetch_dataset.py
```

2. Train the model from scratch using:
```
python train.py
```

3. If you want to verify our results from the paper, you can directly load our pre-trained model's weights and test it using using:
```
python test.py N
```

Here, `N` represents the number of test images to sample from. By default, `N = 10`.

Otherwise, you can freshly train the model before testing, using:
```
python test.py N --train
```
