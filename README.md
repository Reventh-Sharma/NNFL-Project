## Requirements

* **Tensorflow 2.x** (Anything above Tensorflow 2.0)

## Instructions (Running the Python files directly)

*****************************************************************************************************************************************NOTE: The project file small_cnn_model.ipynb trains a smaller CNN model for full batch (or fractional batch with minimum batch size to* *be 1/5th of training data size) calculations as was specified by iterations in paper52. This model, which was maximum that could be   * *build on Google Colab for full batch calculations, used 11.7GBs of RAM when running for these high batch sizes provided in paper. For * *higher accuracy model (similiar to that in paper) trained on batch size = 20 please refer CNN_projet.ipynb on which the presentation  * *and .py files are based.                                                                                                              *
****************************************************************************************************************************************

Instructions for running the code directly:
1. Get the *COIL-100* dataset and place it on `./dataset/coil-100`, **OR** run this helper script, which will automatically do this for you:
```
python fetch_dataset.py
```

2. Train the model from scratch using:
```
python train.py
```

3. If you want to verify our results from the paper, you can directly load our pre-trained model's weights and test it using using:
```
python test.py N
```

Here, `N` represents the number of test images to sample from. By default, `N = 10`.

Otherwise, you can freshly train the model before testing, using:
```
python test.py N --train
```
